# document 

This project contains code that was developed as part of the Scala standard library but was later deprecated. 
We maintain the code mainly because we used it in one of our projects and also as a small and simple test module that we can use to check continuous integration, documentation, cross-scala compilations, tests, and so on.

It consists os a basic pretty-printing library, 
 which was based on Lindig's strict version of Wadler's adaptation of Hughes' pretty-printer derived from 
 [Document.scala](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.8/src/library/scala/text/Document.scala) 
 whose author was Michel Schinz.

You can see the [web page](https://weso.github.io/document) for technical documentation.

* [Strictly Pretty Paper](https://lindig.github.io/papers/strictly-pretty-2000.pdf) by Christian Lindig, describes a strict implementation of the pretty printing algorithm in OCaml
