= Document library 

This project contains code that was developed as part of the Scala standard library but was later deprecated.

A basic pretty-printing library, based on 
https://lindig.github.io/papers/strictly-pretty-2000.pdf[Lindig's strict version] of 
https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf[Wadler's adaptation] of 
http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/pretty.html[Hughes' pretty-printer] derived from 
https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.8/src/library/scala/text/Document.scala[Document.scala] whose original author was 
https://people.epfl.ch/michel.schinz[Michel Schinz]

We maintain it because we had some code using it and because we want an experimental simple Scala code library to test documentation.
